## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Hotel Review Generator seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@hotelreviewgenerator.com**

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Process

1. **Receipt**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: Our security team will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate with you on disclosure timeline
4. **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we'll publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you, if desired)

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
