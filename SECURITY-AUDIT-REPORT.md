#### 2. Hardcoded Encryption Keys
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Location:** `/src/services/CRMIntegrationService.js`
- **Issue:** Default encryption key hardcoded
- **Fix Applied:** Enforced environment variable usage with startup validation

#### 3. XSS via innerHTML
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Location:** Multiple files
- **Issue:** Direct innerHTML assignments
- **Fix Applied:** Replaced with secure DOM manipulation methods

#### 4. Missing HTTPS Enforcement
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Location:** Application-wide
- **Issue:** No runtime HTTPS enforcement
- **Fix Applied:** Added automatic HTTPS redirect and enforcement

### ðŸŸ  HIGH SEVERITY (Fixed)

#### 5. Weak Session Management
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue:** Predictable session ID generation
- **Fix Applied:** Implemented crypto.getRandomValues()

#### 6. Insufficient Input Validation
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue:** Basic XSS prevention
- **Fix Applied:** Integrated DOMPurify for comprehensive sanitization

#### 7. Weak CSP Policy
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue:** 'unsafe-inline' allowed
- **Fix Applied:** Implemented nonce-based CSP

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM SEVERITY (Fixed)

#### 8. Missing Rate Limiting
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Fix Applied:** Implemented memory-based rate limiting

#### 9. Weak Password Requirements
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED
- **Fix Applied:** Enhanced password complexity requirements
